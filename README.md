Project Description
The goal of this project is to analyze an online retail dataset using various data analysis techniques and draw insights from the results. The dataset includes information such as customer demographics, product categories, purchase history, and product reviews. The project focuses on using histograms to visualize numerical data and word clouds to extract insights from product reviews.

Data Cleaning
Before starting the analysis, the dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to remove any irrelevant or missing data, and to convert the data into a suitable format for analysis.

Data Analysis
Once the data was cleaned, various statistical analysis techniques were used to gain insights from the data. This involved calculating measures such as mean, max, and minimum values, and using histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical data.

Visualization
To further enhance the analysis, word clouds were used to extract insights from product reviews. The word clouds provide a visual representation of the most commonly used words in the reviews, which can be used to identify popular products, common complaints, and other patterns.

Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
wordcloud
You can install these libraries using pip, by running the following command:


Usage
To use this project, you will need to download the dataset and run the Python script in a Jupyter notebook or any other suitable environment. The script will perform the necessary data cleaning and analysis, and output the results in the form of histograms and word clouds.
